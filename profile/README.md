#### Roles/Responsibilities
- Machine Learning Team: Building models with TensorFlow lite and TensorFlow. Js, using data pipeline to serve the models, and preprocess the data using Missing Values Imputation.
- Cloud Computing Team: Designed and implemented a cloud-based voting and event management system utilizing Google Cloud's Compute Engine as the core backend infrastructure.
- Mobile Developer Team: Deployment of TensorFlow lite and creation of both a user and an admin app. The application has a real-time connection using Firebase and a mechanism to a data buffer in case an internet connection is unavailable.

## Project Overview
The Liveness Detection System for Secure Online Voting aims to address security vulnerabilities, inefficiencies, and a lack of trust in online voting platforms by introducing LiveVote, a biometric-based solution to ensure vote integrity. The system employs real-time liveness detection to prevent spoofing and unauthorized access, enhancing trust and transparency in the voting process.

## Project Background
LiveVote addresses the challenge of ensuring secure and authentic participation in online voting by incorporating real-time liveness detection to prevent bot activity and fraudulent voting. For security, voters must complete a liveness detection check before casting their vote, verifying that they are human.
